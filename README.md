# Startpage

This start page is made to be able to function as a "New Tab" page in your browser. You can customize it any way you want. A live version of this project (with my configs) can be found here: [antexperiments.gitlab.io/webapps/startpage](https://antexperiments.gitlab.io/webapps/startpage/). The app supports dark mode by reacting to your systems setting.
